        /* Notice that we have two constructors for Zone. C# determines which one to call based on the signature (the list of parameters) from the caller.
         * 
         * The first creates a new button for the grid and associates it with the new zone.
         * 
         * The second associates the new zone with an already-existing button, which is provided by the fourth parameter.
         * 
         * As the game exists currently, we only use the second Zone constructor for the "holding pen", so we could probably rewrite the code to require fewer parameters... but we might find another use for this version later.
         * 
         * Alternatively, we might write more constructors with different signatures in order to handle different Zone creation scenarios!
